# Module Title

**NGS Data formats and QC**

# Authors

This tutorial was written by Jacqui Keane and Sara Sjunnebo based on material from Petr Danecek and Thomas Keane.

# Duration

3 hours

# Key topics

In this module, learners will look at data formats in detail. At the end of the theory, there is a mandatory to test their knowledge.

**FASTQ:** Unaligned read sequences with base qualities

**SAM/BAM:** Unaligned or aligned reads, text and binary formats

**CRAM:** Better compression than BAM

**VCF/BCF:** Flexible variant call format; SNPs, indels, structural variations

# Learning outcomes

• Describe the different NGS data formats available (FASTQ, SAM/BAM, CRAM, VCF/BCF)

• Perform a QC assessment of high throughput sequence data

• Perform conversions between the different data formats

# Activities
