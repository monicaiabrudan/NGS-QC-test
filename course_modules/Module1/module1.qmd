# Key topics

In this module, learners will look at data formats in detail. At the end of the theory, there is a mandatory to test their knowledge.

**SAM/BAM**

• Unaligned or aligned reads

• Text and binary formats

**CRAM**

• Better compression than BAM

**VCF/BCF**

• Flexible variant call format

• Arbitrary types of sequence variation

• SNPs, indels, structural variations
