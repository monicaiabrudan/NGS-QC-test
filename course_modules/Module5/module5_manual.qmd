# 1. Overview of Genome Assembly

Problem: Sequencing technologies produce only short DNA reads.\
Goal: Reconstruct a complete genome from millions to billions of short fragments.\
Methods:\
 - Clone-based sequencing: Select and sequence specific clones.\
 - Whole-genome shotgun sequencing: Fragment and sequence the entire genome.\
 - De novo assembly: Reconstruct the genome without a reference.

# 2. Challenges in Assembly (The Jigsaw Puzzle Analogy)

Many small, damaged, and repetitive pieces make assembly harder.\
Critical factors:\
 - Read length (longer is better)\
 - Error rates (fewer is better)\
 - Repetitive regions cause ambiguity.

# 3. Key Considerations

\- Sequencing coverage\
 - Error rates\
 - Read length\
 - Genome uniqueness\
 - Genome size\
 - Heterozygosity and ploidy\
 - Computational resources (time and memory).

# 4. Basic Terminology

\- Contig: A contiguous stretch of sequence.\
 - Scaffold: Ordered set of contigs with gaps represented by Ns.

# 5. Sequencing Technologies

PacBio Sequencing:\
 - Very long reads, detects base modifications.\
 - High error rate, expensive.\
\
Nanopore Sequencing:\
 - Portability, ultra-long reads.\
 - High error rates, systematic errors near homopolymers.\
\
Linked-Reads and Read Clouds:\
 - Bridges long repeats and improves assembly continuity.\
\
Hi-C Data:\
 - Captures chromatin conformation to assist chromosome-scale assembly.\
\
Optical Mapping:\
 - Labels and images long DNA fragments for structural scaffolding.

# 6. Long-Range Technologies Comparison

Platforms: PacBio, Nanopore, 10X Genomics, Hi-C, Optical mapping.\
Each technology offers distinct advantages and bioinformatic challenges.

# 7. Example Project Workflow

Technologies are integrated sequentially for high-quality genome assembly.\
Example: Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP).

# 8. Assembly Methods

Contig Generation:\
 - OLC (Overlap-Layout-Consensus): Good for long reads.\
 - de Bruijn Graphs (DBG): Good for short reads.

# 9. Common Hurdles

\- Heterozygosity\
 - Sequencing errors\
 - Repeats\
 - Low-complexity regions\
 - Base composition biases.

# 10. Quality Metrics

\- Total assembly length\
 - Number of contigs and scaffolds\
 - N50, NG50\
 - Gene content assessments.

# 11. Scaffolding and Chromosome Assignment

Sources: Mate-pair libraries, Hi-C, Optical maps.\
Tools like RACA help build chromosome-scale scaffolds.

# 12. Diploid Assembly

Problem: Standard assemblers assume haploidy.\
Solutions:\
 - Falcon-Unzip: Haplotyping assembly.\
 - Purge Haplotigs: Removes haplotype duplications.\
 - Falcon-Phase: Phases haplotypes using Hi-C data.\
 - Trio Binning: Uses parental reads for haplotype separation.

# 13. Assembly Quality Control

Gene Content: BUSCO analysis.\
Base Accuracy: Realign reads to detect errors.\
Structural Accuracy: Using known structural data and tools like QUAST, REAPR.

# 14. Specialized Assemblies

Metagenomic Assembly:\
 - For mixed-organism samples (e.g., environmental DNA).\
\
Transcriptome Assembly:\
 - For RNA sequencing data.

# 15. Large Genome Projects

Tree of Life Project and Darwin Tree of Life: Massive efforts to sequence all eukaryotic life in Britain.\
Achievements: New assemblies of Lepidoptera.\
Highlight: Complete chromosome assemblies achieved, e.g., human X chromosome.
