Differential Expression using RNA-Seq

Instructor: Vivek Iyer

Source Material: Based extensively on slides by Victoria Offord (Wellcome Sanger Institute)

Date: 7 June 2024

# 1. Learning Objectives

·       Design an RNA-Seq experiment appropriately.

·       Understand the RNA-Seq data processing pipeline.

·       Map reads to a genome and a transcriptome.

·       Visualize RNA-Seq data.

·       Quantify transcript expression.

·       Perform quality control (QC) of RNA-Seq data.

·       Interpret differential gene expression (DGE) results.

# 2. Introduction and Context

·       RNA-Seq enables the sequencing of messenger RNA (mRNA), offering a 'snapshot' of the transcriptome under specific conditions.

# 3. Fundamental Concepts

·       The Central Dogma: DNA → (transcription) → Pre-mRNA → (splicing, capping, tailing) → mRNA → (translation) → Protein.

·       RNA-Seq targets stable mRNA, easier to capture than proteins.

# 4. RNA-Seq Experimental Design

·       Good design is critical to answer biological questions effectively.

·       Key Design Aspects:

·       - Library Preparation: Enrich for mRNA or deplete rRNA.

·       - Stranded vs. Unstranded Libraries: Resolve overlapping transcripts.

·       - Sequencing Depth: Standard \~30 million paired-end reads/sample.

·       - Replicates: Biological replicates are essential.

# 5. RNA-Seq Data Analysis Pipeline

·       There is no 'one-size-fits-all' pipeline.

·       Step 1: Mapping Reads: To the Genome (e.g., HISAT2) and to the Transcriptome (e.g., Kallisto).

·       Step 2: Read Quantification.

·       Step 3: Normalization: Correct for sequencing depth and gene length biases.

·       Step 4: QC and Differential Expression: Detect issues, interpret results.

# 6. Quality Control (QC)

·       Sample QC: Sequencing depth, alignment rate, PCA clustering.

·       Flagging outliers is crucial to prevent false positives/negatives.

# 7. Differential Gene Expression Analysis

·       Tools: Sleuth, DESeq2, EdgeR, limma-voom.

·       Important Concepts: Size factors, linear modeling, multiple testing correction.

# 8. Interpreting Your Results

·       Have a hypothesis? Test it.

·       Perform GO term/pathway enrichment analysis.

·       Explore key genes manually.

·       Visualize with volcano plots to prioritize genes.

# 9. Practical Exercise

·       Organism: Plasmodium chabaudi (rodent malaria parasite).

·       Compare transcriptomes between mosquito-transmitted (MT) and serial blood passage (SBP) parasites.

·       Biological Question: Is the parasite's transcriptome different after mosquito passage?
