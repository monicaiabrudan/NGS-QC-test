### Q1.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Germline mutations occur in egg or sperm cells, meaning they are heritable, while somatic mutations occur in non-reproductive tissues and are not passed on.

### Q2. 

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: A duplication involving 2 kb is an example of a copy number variant, which is considered a large-scale variation.

### Q3.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: SNVs refer to single base substitutions, and indels refer to small insertions or deletions generally less than 50 bp.

### Q4.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Determining the speed of DNA replication is not a direct application of variant calling.

### Q5.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Phased haplotypes allow for the determination of which variants are inherited together on the same chromosome, enhancing genotype interpretation.

### Q6.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: "TEMP" is not a standard field in the VCF format, while CHROM, POS, and ALT are.

### Q7.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The correct order is to generate sequencing data, perform quality control, align the reads, generate a pileup, and then call variants.

### Q8.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Homopolymers and repetitive regions are known to cause systematic errors in sequencing and mapping, leading to inaccuracies in variant calling.

### Q9.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: High-quality human SNP datasets typically have a Ts/Tv ratio of around 2 to 3.

### Q10.

Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Population-level datasets provide valuable insights into human genetic diversity and help determine variant frequencies across various populations.
