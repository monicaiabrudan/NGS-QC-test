### Q1

What is the main difference between germline mutations and somatic mutations?

A. Germline mutations occur in non-reproductive cells, while somatic mutations occur in reproductive cells.

B. Germline mutations are heritable as they occur in egg or sperm cells, while somatic mutations occur in non-germline tissues and are not passed to offspring.

C. Germline mutations only occur in bacteria, while somatic mutations are found only in humans.

D. Both types of mutations are heritable but affect different chromosomes.

### Q2

Which of the following is an example of a large-scale genomic variation?

A. A point mutation in a single base.

B. A duplication involving 2 kilobases of DNA (CNV).

C. A small insertion or deletion of 10 base pairs.

D. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).

### Q3

Which statement best describes the difference between single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels?

A. SNVs involve changes in multiple adjacent bases; indels involve changes in just one base.

B. SNVs are large deletions; indels are large insertions.

C. SNVs involve single base substitutions, while indels are small insertions or deletions typically less than 50 base pairs.

D. SNVs occur only in coding regions; indels occur only in non-coding regions.

### Q4

Which of the following is NOT a practical application of variant calling?

A. Cataloging biological diversity in population genetics.

B. Identifying pathogenic mutations for disease diagnosis.

C. Determining the speed of DNA replication during cell division.

D. Tailoring drug dosages in pharmacogenomics.

### Q5

What is the benefit of resolving phased haplotypes in variant calling analyses?

A. It provides information about the total number of chromosomes in the organism.

B. It determines which variants are inherited together on the same chromosome, thereby clarifying genotype information.

C. It helps to identify only somatic mutations exclusively.

D. It replaces the need for any sequencing data.

### Q6

Which key field is NOT typically included in a Variant Call Format (VCF) file?

A. CHROM (chromosome)

B. POS (position)

C. TEMP (temperature of the sample)

D. ALT (alternate allele)

### Q7

Which sequence correctly describes the process from raw sequencing data to final variant calls?

A. Alignment, Quality Control, Generate Sequencing Data, Pileup, Variant Calling.

B. Generate Sequencing Data, Alignment, Quality Control, Variant Calling, Pileup.

C. Generate Sequencing Data, Quality Control, Alignment, Pileup, Variant Calling.

D. Pileup, Generate Sequencing Data, Quality Control, Alignment, Variant Calling.

### Q8

Which of the following is a common source of error in variant calling?

A. Uniform base composition across the genome.

B. Homopolymers and repetitive regions causing sequencing and mapping errors.

C. Excessively high mapping quality in all reads.

D. Infrequent occurrence of strand bias in high-quality datasets.

### Q9

The transition/transversion (Ts/Tv) ratio is used as a quality metric in SNP datasets. What Ts/Tv ratio is typically expected in high-quality human SNP calls?

A. Approximately 0.5–1

B. Approximately 1–2

C. Approximately 2–3

D. Approximately 4–5

### Q10

How do population-level datasets like those from the 1000 Genomes Project and gnomAD aid researchers?

A. They provide a comprehensive snapshot of human genetic diversity and variant frequencies across various populations.

B. They measure the metabolic rates of individuals in diverse populations.

C. They only include data from European populations.

D. They offer real-time monitoring of gene expression levels.
