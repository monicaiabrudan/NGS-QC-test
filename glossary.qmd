**Adapter** Short, synthetic DNA sequences ligated to sequencing fragments to enable amplification and sequencing. Often removed during quality control.

**Alignment** The process of mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome using tools like BWA or Bowtie2.

**Base Quality Score (Phred Score)** A measure of the confidence in a base call during sequencing. Higher scores indicate lower probability of error.

**BAM (Binary Alignment Map)** A compressed, binary version of a SAM file that contains aligned sequencing reads.

**Coverage (Depth)** The number of reads covering a particular position in the genome. Higher coverage improves variant calling accuracy.

**FASTQ File** A text-based format containing raw sequencing reads and their associated base quality scores.

**GC Bias** Systematic errors in sequencing data caused by the over- or under-representation of reads in GC-rich or GC-poor regions.

**Indel** A small insertion or deletion of bases in the genome that can be detected during variant calling.

**Mapping Quality (MAPQ)** A score indicating the confidence that a read is correctly aligned to a unique location in the reference genome.

**MultiQC** A tool that aggregates results from various QC tools into a single, comprehensive report.

**Quality Control (QC)** The process of assessing and improving the quality of raw sequencing data before downstream analysis.

**Read Trimming** The removal of low-quality bases or adapter sequences from the ends of reads to improve mapping and variant calling.

**Reference Genome** A standard genome sequence used as a reference to align sequencing reads and identify differences (variants).

**SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)** A text-based format for storing read alignments to a reference genome.

**SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism)** A single base change in the genome. One of the most common types of genetic variation.

**Structural Variant (SV)** A large-scale genomic alteration such as deletions, duplications, inversions, or translocations.

**Variant Calling** The process of identifying genetic variants (SNPs, indels, etc.) by comparing sequencing data to a reference genome.

**Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)** A tool that annotates variants with information about their potential functional effects on genes and proteins.

**VCF (Variant Call Format)** A standard file format for storing variant calls and associated metadata.

**Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)** Sequencing that covers the entire genome, providing comprehensive data for variant analysis.
